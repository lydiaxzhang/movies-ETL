# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
The following project provided Amazing Prime Video, a platform for streaming movies and TV shows, with a database of movie datasets to be used in their upcoming hackathon. The result of the hackathon will hopefully be an algorithm for predicting movie success. The database will be generated using the ETL (extract, transform, load) process with data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens.
